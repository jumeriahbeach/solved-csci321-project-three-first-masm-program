<strong>Objectives:</strong>

<ol>

 <li>Set up Visual Studio 2015</li>

 <li>Be able to code, assemble, and execute a program that adds and subtracts integers</li>

 <li>Be able to define symbolic constants</li>

 <li>Be able to create variables using all standard assembly language data types</li>

</ol>

<strong>Problem Description:</strong>

First set up Visual Studio 2015 on your computer. You may follow the instruction on <a href="http://kipirvine.com/asm/">authorâ€™s website</a>. Based on the version of you Visual Studio, you may click on <a href="http://kipirvine.com/asm/gettingStartedVS2013/index.htm">Getting Started with MASM and Visual Studio 2013</a> or <a href="http://kipirvine.com/asm/gettingStartedVS2015/index.htm">Getting started with MASM and Visual Studio 2015</a> to follow the instruction. When reach the installation section of instruction, you need to click link to download and follow the instruction to install <a href="http://kipirvine.com/asm/examples/Irvine_7th_Edition.msi">Example programs and link library source code for the Seventh Edition</a>. If you use VS2015, you may download <a href="http://kipirvine.com/asm/examples/Project32_VS2015.zip">Updated 32-bit Visual Studio project for VS2015</a>. Please notice, if you use this updated project, the existing example source file AddTwo needs to be removed from the project then add to project again appropriately.

Write a program that contain the following:

<ol>

 <li>Using the AddTwo program from Section 3.2 as a reference, write code to calculate the following expression, using registers: A = (A+B)-(C+D). Assign integer values to the EAX, EBX, ECX, and EDX registers</li>

 <li>Write code that defines symbolic constants for all seven days of the week. Create an array variable that uses the symbols as initializers</li>

 <li>The program must contain a definition of each data type listed in Table 3.2 in Section 3.4 of the textbook. Initialize each variable to a value that is consistent with its data type</li>

 <li>Write code defines symbolic names for several string literals. Use each symbolic name in a variable definition</li>

</ol>

Basically, these are Programming Exercises 1-4 on page 94 of the textbook. Instead of writing four separated program, you just write one program to contain all features listed above.
